## Reference and Output Files

Below are key reference and output files used in this workflow:

- **`iuis.bed`**  
  BED file containing genomic coordinates for region-based filtering. This file is based on the 2022 **International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS)** gene list.

- **`IUIS_OMIM_220628.xlsx`**  
  Excel file mapping IUIS genes to their associated OMIM entries. This file was used for all OMIM-based filtering and ClinVar matching, as well as for determining the inheritance patterns of specific diseases.

- **`vexas_variants.bed`**  
  BED file listing the **UBA1** gene whitelist variants used for VEXAS syndrome analysis.

- **`clinvar_2025_March`**  
  ClinVar variant dataset (2025 March release) used to filter for variants with high-confidence associations to inborn errors of immunity (IEI), based on the curated OMIM codes.

- **`final_pathogenic_df.csv`**  
  Final output table generated by the full workflow. This CSV contains the list of participants carrying likely pathogenic/pathogenic (LP/P) variants, including both genomic annotations and relevant clinical metadata, and serves as the basis for all downstream statistical analyses.
